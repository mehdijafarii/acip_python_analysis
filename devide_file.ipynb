      "{'end_time': '14:38 ', 'character_lenght': 10691, 'text': \" Good morning, my name is Demetre Daskalakis. And greetings on day two of ACIP. I'm the director -- the Acting Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory diseases. And again, it's a pleasure to see you for day two. So I'll start by just talking a little bit about what our primary focus is at this time of year, which is our respiratory virus season. So I think as you all are aware, and your partnership is so important in this protecting people against respiratory diseases, this fall or winter is really not a top priority for the agency but also a top priority for the nation. It's important to protect people and important to also protect health care so that we have the capacity to do to treat and care for people who don't have respiratory diseases. It's good news, we are thankfully in our strongest position that we've ever been for fighting these respiratory conditions, COVID-19 respiratory syncytial virus or RSV and flu. So of course, with such an erudite group, it's really important to note we know that there's more than three that we work with during the season and other seasons. But because there are many exciting interventions that we have for these, we have a lot of focus, as well as the fact that these three tend to be the ones that are detectably causing the largest strain on healthcare and burden of disease. So in terms of where we are today, currently COVID-19 activity continues to decline in most parts of the country. But when you look at the overall story, it remains the principal cause at this time of year of respiratory virus associated hospitalizations and deaths. Influenza activity does also remain relatively low, but not for long. We're seeing activity starting to increase in the country and right now some areas, particularly Alaska and the Mariana Islands, are actually seeing a pretty significant increase in influenza. Also, we are officially now in RSV season, we've hit the 3% threshold. And we are seeing the normal progression of RSV in the country starting in the south, and slowly making its way up north with the expectation that we will be in RSV land in the United States the whole way in about one to two months. A couple of important things to highlight, on October 23, CDC published a health care provider toolkit, preparing your patients for the fall and winter season. This toolkit is great. It provides clinical and other partners talking points. So we're all really on the same page of how to talk to people, other providers and people that you care for about flu, COVID-19, and RSV, as well as their interventions, including vaccines and treatments. Also, with some focus on coadministration, and some print materials that can go to patients so that we can really be on the same page for communicating. So not shockingly, I will tout the importance of vaccines here, that vaccines remain the safest protection to avoid hospitalization, also long-term health impacts and death. It's again, as you all know, especially important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious complications. That includes older adults and folks who have weakened immune systems. Though it's a campaign that focuses on flu, so much of this deaths sort of fall into the wild to mild category, that these vaccines are taming these infections, really an effective way of communicating what the role of these vaccines are in people's health, as well as in public health. So bottom line is that we encourage everyone and really appreciate your help in being frontline warriors in this, we encourage people to stay up to date on their vaccinations. Another really important piece of what's happening this season is that we've had a very significant change in the way COVID-19 vaccine is distributed in the United States. So we have had the experience of the largest U.S. government implemented vaccination program in U.S. history, 700 million doses of COVID-19 vaccination that have been administered to over 270 million people. That's amazing. On September 15, something changed, a switch was flipped, in effect, where we went from U.S. government distribution of COVID 19 vaccine into distribution through commercial networks. And I think that's been really instructive in terms of some of the very important observations that strategies for public health distribution of vaccine tend to be different than strategies for commercial distribution of vaccine. And I think, despite, you know, a year plus of planning, definitely some very important lessons learned about how public health can potentially better influence how commercial vaccine moves in the country. So what we also learned is that we don't have a vaccines for adult program. And so as we see COVID-19 vaccine going on to the commercial market, there was a significant concern that we really needed to make sure that uninsured or underinsured people who live here are able to access vaccination, regardless of their insurance status. And so thus was born bridge, a bridge to somewhere I hope. CDC launched the COVID-19 vaccine bridge access program in mid-September, very accelerated, large, large program that really created the possibility of access for 25 to 30 million Americans who are uninsured and then additional people living in the country who are underinsured. The Bridge Program leverages unique public private partnerships with pharmacies, as well as with manufacturers of vaccine to really create a two-channel system, one that's a public health channel that really focuses on our vaccine partners that work in health departments, and the providers that they have that administer a vaccine to their jurisdiction. But then also really great partnerships with the very important channel retail pharmacy channel where we have three partners that are participating in really creating a sort of double headed net, to be able to provide people access to vaccine. So I'm going to go back to the story of bridge and say, It's great because it provides COVID-19 vaccination. It's temporary, and it only provides COVID-19 vaccination. And so this is really sort of where I pivot for a moment to say, vaccines for adults is a really important strategy. We know that vaccines for children is a game changer, you know, I come from many various infectious disease spaces in my career. And I always step back and think that the two things that you see really having really enormously high impact in terms of public health interventions, Ryan White and VFC. So these are just so important in the world in terms of being able to provide people the prevention and services that they need to stay healthy. So a bridge to somewhere I hope it's a bridge to VFA. And so really thinking about strategies that we can create a program in the U.S., that is not a two-legged stool that's a little wobbly, but a three-legged stool that includes the 317 program VFC and VFA. So that we can actually, you know, create that prevention strategy that works so well, since we know that vaccines prevent a lot of bad things. Speaking of that time to talk about VFC. VFC is amazing. It is a federally funded mandatory entitlement program that provides vaccines at no cost to children who might not otherwise get them. And so I'm sure you've heard these figures before. But it's always good to remember. Imagine what we could do if we had both VFA and VFC. In its 30-year history, happy anniversary VFC, it has prevented 472 million illnesses. Over 1 million deaths and nearly 2.2 trillion, with a T, in societal costs. Seems like a really good idea. Every dollar spent on saves $10, almost $11 in projected health care costs. We know that since 1994 VFC has been critical in increasing rates of vaccine uptake in us kids, reducing vaccine preventable diseases and as I said, it is an equity intervention that really reaches the most vulnerable people who otherwise may not be able to get vaccine. VFC is important because -- for lots of reasons, but one of its main purposes is to buy vaccine, 90% of that program funding comes from that. So I get asked frequently, what is the difference between like VFC VFA and 317? 317, about 3% of its budget goes to purchasing vaccine and it's kind of an emergency safety valve, provides infrastructure that supports VFC and could support VFA three legs to the stool are really critical to be able to achieve the goal. Now I want to talk a bit about something that is really important to be aware of, I think you all are tracking very closely, nirsevimab and what we're seeing with some of the supply constraints, so as you know we're aware that nirsevimab, which is a very important lung acting preventative antibody, that is to prevent RSV illness in newborns has some limited supply. And on October 23, CDC issued a health alert or a HAN that advises health care providers to prioritize the antibody to those who need it most. So young infants birth age through five months, infants with high risk conditions. And then also we know that it's really critical to have this reach American Indian and Alaska Native infants given the burden of disease that we see in that population, especially if they're in remote settings. Additionally, in that health alert, we also reminded people of alternatives for some babies and newborns between eight to 19 months with certain medical conditions. So specifically palivizumab so that we are able to spare some of the 100 milligram doses, which is where we're seeing some of the issue or most of the issue. So again, we also highlight that there is another way so a couple of has to protection for newborns for RSV, and that includes vaccination in pregnant persons. I think you all met about that on October 22. So you're all on top of it. So again, we continue to be in really close contact with Sanofi to make sure that we have a chart forward for the season just remembering again, commercial distribution and supply is different than public health or U.S. government distribution or supplies. So it's really lucky that we have a strong partnership to be able to make sure that we are in close communication. I do however, again want to uplift a point that we do have nirsevimab, we have palivizumab and we also have vaccination in in pregnant persons reminding you that the that the recommendation is 32 to 36 weeks of pregnancy. So again, vaccines critically important. It's important to get them to people both from the manufacturing and distribution side, but also from the access and coverage side. So I think that we are in a place of strength, but also we have some really important areas to continue to address so that we maintain that strength and do it in an equitable way. Thank you. \", 'time_delta': 691, 'start_time': '3:07 '}\n",

      "{'end_time': '17:44 ', 'character_lenght': 2294, 'text': \" This is Mary Beth Hance and I have a few updates from CMS, which we'll touch -- be very consistent with what we just heard from CDC. One thing we wanted to just highlight, although I'm sure many people are aware is that the Inflation Reduction Act provision that would require that traditional Medicaid cover all ACIP recommended vaccines without cost sharing went into effect on October 1. These are adults who are in what we call traditional Medicaid, which is the pre-expansion, Medicaid. Previously, vaccines were optional for states and there could be cost sharing. We know that all states covered some, but most did not cover all ACIP recommended vaccines. And this is a very exciting day that we're in from the Medicaid perspective and vaccines for adults. Obviously, there's still a lot of work to do in this space. But this is an important step forward. So again, that went into effect on October 1, we did issue guidance to states as well as a fact sheet at the end of June. Moving on to recent vaccinations, and most importantly, coordination with CDC. As you've just heard, there has been a lot of things happening this fall, and we have worked very closely with CDC on all of them. Obviously, the commercialization of COVID vaccines was a very important transition, and CMS was in the middle of it. We worked really hard to amplify messaging to get information out to be consistent with what CDC was sharing. And I really appreciate CDC colleagues coming and speaking to Medicaid agencies about the Bridge Access Program and making sure that they were aware of that. We also have worked very closely with CDC around the new products that are available for RSV, and amplifying important information about them being available, including the supply issues that we just heard about and making sure everyone knows of everything that is available in this space. It is also important that we don't lose sight of our routine immunizations, with, you know, everything else that's happening in the space. So we continue to amplify the importance of routine immunizations, and have reiterated that message many, many times to states as we're also making sure that states are aware and other partners are aware of all these important changes happening in this space.

Since the last ACIP agency report in June of 2023 in apropos to yesterday and today's ACIP meeting, FDA has approved or authorized 10 vaccine products issued an updated guidance to industry and convened one vaccines and related Biologics products Advisory Committee. On June 30, CBER approved a change to the prescribing information of Dengvaxia. The dengue tetravalent vaccine live to include safety and efficacy data that support the use of Dengvaxia in individuals six years through 16 years of age, with laboratory confirm previous dengue infection and living in endemic areas. On July 20, CBER approved Cyfendus, anthrax vaccine absorbed, adjuvanted indicated for post exposure prophylaxis of disease following suspected or confirmed exposure to Bacillus anthracis in persons 18 through 65 years of age when administered in conjunction with recommended anti-bacterial drugs. On July 27, CBER approved a change to the prescribing information of ERVEBO, the Ebola Zaire Vaccine live vaccine to extend the indication for use to individuals 12 months of age and older. On August 21st, CBER approved ABRYSVO, the respiratory syncytial virus vaccine indicated for active immunization of pregnant individuals at 32 to 36 weeks gestational age for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease and severe lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus in infants from birth through six months of age. On September 11, CBER approved Comirnaty and Spikevax 2023/2024 formula COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for use in individuals 12 years of age and older and amended the emergency use authorizations of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and Pfizer biotech COVID-19 vaccines to include the 2023/2024 formula for use in individual six months through 11 years of age to prevent COVID 19. Then on October 3, CBER amended the emergency use authorization of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine adjuvanted to include the 2023/2024 formula for use in individuals 12 years of age and older to prevent COVID-19. On October 20, CBER approved Penbraya, meningococcal groups A, B, C, W and Y vaccine indicated for active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups, A, B, C, W, and R, the vaccine is approved for use in individuals 10 through 25 years of age. And on October 19, CBRE issued an updated development and licensure of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 guidance for industry to assist sponsors in the clinical development and licensure of vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. And then finally, on October 5, VRBPAC convened an open session to discuss the strain selection for influenza virus vaccines for the 2024 Southern Hemisphere influenza season. The committee unanimously recommended excluding the B/Yamagata lineage component from quadrivalent influenza vaccines as soon as possible, as well as recommended the composition for egg-based trivalent and quadrivalent 2024 Southern Hemisphere formulations of influenza vaccines. And if I might, I'd like to personally thank the review teams, the supervisors and the management at CBER who work diligently to thoroughly review these 10 regulatory actions since the June 2023 ACIP meeting. And I'd also like to thank the many CDC staff for their many contributions and their alacrity in these efforts.

The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program or as we call the VICP continues to process a high volume of claims in fiscal year 2023. Petitioners had filed 1129 claims with the VICP and nearly $174 million have been awarded including awards to petitioners and their attorney's fees and costs. In addition, the VICP had a backlog of 657 claims alleging vaccine injury that were awaiting review. Previously, there had been nearly a 12 month wait time between when a petition was found to have adequate medical records to review. By the time HRSA provider was able to review it. And as of October 1, 2023, those wait times had been reduced significantly to below a six month wait time. So we are working through the backlog in that VICP program. More data about the VICP can be obtained at the VICPs website which is hrsa.gov /vaccinetechcompensation. For our other injury compensation program, the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program in the decade prior to COVID-19, only 500 claims have been filed with the CICP, CICP received its first direct appropriation in fiscal year 2022. And the program has used those funds to increase its capacity to conduct medical reviews. By hiring and training new review staff and contractors as well as to pay compensable claims and to improve information technology and other communication with requesters. The CICP recently made it improvements to foster enhanced communication with requesters, allowing the requesters the capability of checking their claim status in real time at injurycompensation.hrsa.gov and launching a chat function on its website to assist requesters with frequently asked questions. As of October 1, 2023. There have been 12,233 claims alleging injuries or death from COVID-19 countermeasures that have been filed with the CICP including 9221 claims alleging injuries from COVID-19 vaccines. CICP has rendered 1267 decisions on COVID-19 claims and more information in depth data about the CICP can be found at www.hrsa.gov/cicpdata.

The Indian Health Service continues to prioritize vaccination as our principal clinical and public health prevention priority. As part of our IHS national E3 vaccines strategy, we seek to ensure that every patient at every encounter is offered every recommended vaccine when appropriate. In partnership with staff at our federal tribal and urban Indian organization facilities, we have collected and shared best practices and lessons learned from dozens of E3 champions pilot sites across the country for cross pollination of our IHS system of care. We are actively engaged in our fall respiratory viral season vaccine campaign, with the goal to mitigate morbidity and mortality from vaccine preventable illness in our vulnerable service population. Following approval of the 2023/2024, monovalent COVID 19 vaccine, and RSV vaccines for elders and pregnant women. The IHS distributed guidance to clinicians, public health staff, tribal leaders and tribal communities about the importance of these countermeasures. Similarly coincided with the ACIP recommendations, the Indian Health Service took quick action to add nirsevimab to the IHS National Core formulary to further promote access to this immunization for infants and young children. We have also reached out to our federal, tribal and urban Indian organization partners to provide guidance about the recommendation that all infants under eight months of age and their first RSV season, and all American Indian and Alaskan Native children eight to 19 months of age in their second RSV season, receive nirsevimab. Currently, all ACIP recommended vaccines and long-acting monoclonal antibodies are listed on the IHS National Core formulary. In addition, IHS continues as a long-term partner with the Vaccines for Children program. And IHS also remains committed to providing support to facilities interested in the CDCs Bridge Access Program for COVID vaccines for eligible persons. Moving forward in collaboration with our partners and tribal communities, we will continue to promote access, quality, value and equity related to immunizations in Indian country. That concludes the IHS report. Thank you. ', 'time_delta': 140, 'start_time': '25:23 '}\n",

      "{'end_time': '32:29 ', 'character_lenght': 4067, 'text': \" Yeah, good morning. This is John Beigel. From the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. I have several updates from the National Institute of Health. For COVID-19 several months ago, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority announced project NextGen. This is a coordinated effort where federal government works with private sector to advance pipeline of new and innovative vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. NextGen vaccines include those with an enhanced breath, improved durability, and those that with the ability to block transmission or infection including mucosal vaccines. And we're looking for ways to improve upon the currently approved vaccines. And I have plans to leverage existing infrastructure and networks to implement these studies. Evaluating multiple next generation COVID-19 links to the program will be in the written updates but you can also run them by internet search. For mpox we spoke yesterday about immunogenicity trial with JYNNEOS mpox vaccine. This includes an evaluation of a lower intradermal dose and a non-inferiority adolescent safety and immunogenicity trial that both stages have completed enrollment. The data for the initial results for the intradermal stage are expected early 2024 with the adolescent data coming later. For meningitis researchers from the NIAID funded infectious disease Clinical Research Consortium provided an interim report on the pentavalent meningococcal serogroup, A, C, Y, W, X conjugate vaccine in comparison to the A, C, W, W, Y conjugate vaccine that this was presented to the WHO strategic advisory group of experts also known as sage. This is different and just to be clear, this is different than the pentavalent the vaccine discussed yesterday including serogroup X, which is seen in many African countries. The study results showed that the pentavalent vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic. This pentavalent vaccine had already been shown immunogenic and approved actually, for people's age one to 85. But this was the pivotal study that extended that down into the infant age group so that that vaccine can be used as part of routine immunization schedule in low- and middle-income countries. For HIV NIAID continues to support multiple programs in pursuit of an HIV vaccine. One recent example to highlight the first and human trial by HIV vaccine development by NIAID's Vaccine Research Center, which includes an engineered outer domain germline targeting 60mer nanoparticle. It's designed to prime VRC 01 class HIV specific B cells. This is a strategy that is prime in B cells and then you refine them with additional antigens in order to develop these broadly neutralizing antibodies. The result of this early phase clinical study was published earlier in Science Translational Medicine and the links will be in the written comments. Now for sexually transmitted disease in response to the persistent health challenges of HSV, the NIH released a strategic plan on HSV research. This includes a framework with a force strategic priorities, including improving fundamental knowledge of HSV biology, pathogenesis and epidemiology, improving HSV diagnostics, improving strategies to treat HSV. And while seeking curative therapeutic and advancing work on preventative measures, including HSV vaccine. So hopefully this will help stimulate and lead to effective HSV vaccines. And lastly, for leadership updates. Dr. Tabak who was the Acting Director of the NIH named Jeanne Marrazzo as the Director of NIAID. Dr. Marrazzo is well known by many people in this group. She's internationally recognized for her research and education efforts in the field of STIs, especially as they affect women's health. And we're very excited to have Dr. Marrazzo leading NIAID as we continue efforts for new and better vaccines. So details and links for all these as well as additional updates will be provided in the written summary. This concludes the updates from the National Institute of Health. \", 'time_delta': 280, 'start_time': '27:49 '}\n",

On behalf of Sanofi vaccines and our alliance partner AstraZeneca I appreciate the opportunity that NCIRD is providing for us to comment on the current market situation for Beyfortus or nirsevimab. As Dr. Daskalakis shared, we're experiencing unprecedented demand for Beyfortus in response to the unmet need that has existed in RSV prevention. Despite an aggressive supply plan built with the goal of outperforming past pediatric immunization launches and built to anticipate the demand of this season, the demand that has materialized has been much higher than forecasted across both the 50 milligram and 100 milligram presentations. Both product dose presentations do continue to ship to fulfill existing orders, however, for the 100 milligram presentation, we have stopped accepting new orders as demand has consumed the supply currently available for the season. We will continue shipping doses of 100 milligram to fulfill orders already on hand over the coming weeks, orders are still being accepted for the 50 milligram presentation. We're working closely in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure equitable distribution of available doses through the VFC program. Our approach for fulfilling existing orders and in taking new orders for the 50 milligram product across the private marketplace will also be done in a similar manner with equity in mind. We appreciate the clinical guidance provided by CDC earlier this week via the HAN that was mentioned before. Additionally, we're working with the FDA together with AstraZeneca, our partner in charge of the manufacturing and supply to deliver all of the doses planned for this season. We appreciate the challenge that these supply constraints present for providers and parents as well as for CDC, the FDA and AAP and others as we introduce Beyfortus. We're thankful for your patience and your collaboration. We're already working to ensure that will be sufficient supply available for next season as we continue to focus on making this season's doses available as rapidly as possible. We will continue to update you and providers on the status of orders and remaining shipments for any questions about the status of Beyfortus orders currently placed directly with Santa Fe. Providers can reach out to their local Santa Fe representative or call 1855 Beyfortus regarding private sector doses. For public sector doses providers can reach out to their state and local VFC program. Again, thank you for this opportunity to comment. Sanofi and AstraZeneca appreciate the patience of the immunization community as we work together through this introductory season.

So just briefly, I think we'll have sort of a better view of what's happening in terms of coverage, as we go further in this season. But in general, I'll say that because this is a commercially distributed vaccine, we've been really in close contact with manufacturers and distributors to have a sense of sort of what's happening on the ground, as well as really close discussions with our shareholders around the country, including professional organizations, et cetera. So I'll start by saying it does not appear to be a bottleneck in production of the vaccine. So from the perspective of what we've heard from manufacturers as well as from distributors, vaccine is flowing. What we are hearing is that there are some barriers related to concerns around coverage. So CDC is actively engaging across, again, shareholders that deal with coverage, both governmental, CMS and also others to make sure the message is clear, the importance of this vaccine product for pregnant people and for their newborns. Additionally, many engagements have happened and more are planned to be able to sort of tout the importance of the vaccine and also to do some myth busting around sort of what is available, as well as what we sort of forecast will be the coverage scenarios. There will be some coverage issues because there are some limits to the speed at which a private insurer needs to cover this, but we're engaging with them as well to again, highlight the importance of a public health view into strategies that tend to be more on the commercial side of the fence.

But just, you know, for the 100 milligrams, they are -- a baby is getting double that. So once they cross five kilos, they're getting double that amount, but I don't have any specific data on that. But I will also support what Julian said is that, you know, in the HAN it's not recommended to give two 50s, because of concerns potentially about the 50 milligram and we could give it to two babies who are younger, rather than one baby who's older, but I know that there are older babies who are at very high risk as well. \", 'time_delta': 60, 'start_time': '42:52 '}\n",

      "{'end_time': '49:12 ', 'character_lenght': 3699, 'text': \" Thank you Dr. Lee and good morning. Next slide. The combined immunization schedule work group updates the child and adolescent and adult immunization schedules annually. The child and adolescent immunization schedule summarizes ACIPs vaccination recommendations for persons 18 years of age or younger, and the adult immunization schedule summarizes ACIPs vaccination recommendations for persons 19 years of age or older. Both immunization schedules represent current approved ACIP policy and are designed to be a guide for healthcare providers to ensure individuals get all their vaccines when they need them. Next slide. The goal of the combined immunization schedule work group is to better harmonize the child adolescent schedule and the adult schedules, no new policy is established by the schedule rather it reflects a summary of ACIP recommendations. Next slide. I would like to remind the committee and the audience why we present the schedule for a vote every fall. ACIP is approval is necessary prior to publication of the immunization schedules by CDC. In addition, ACIPs approval is necessary before our partners from the professional organizations listed on this slide approve the schedules. Next slide. This slide depicts the traditional timeline we have used to publish the immunization schedules, the accompanying MMWR article and the adult schedule in the Annals of Internal Medicine. All publications occur on the same day in early February each year. Next slide. The traditional timeline and process of updating the schedules has resulted in a few significant challenges in implementation of routine vaccinations. This includes insurance reimbursements to health care providers, the ability of certain health care providers such as pharmacists to administer vaccines in some jurisdictions, and delays in updating health care providers knowledge and practices related to new vaccine recommendations. Next slide. To mitigate some of these challenges, we are proposing publishing the 2024 immunization schedules web PDF and app versions -- and app versions in November 2023. The MMWR article summarizing the updates to the 2024 schedule will then be published a few months later, but earlier than the current February dates. Next slide. I would like to acknowledge the exceptional leadership of our CDC colleagues, Dr. Patricia Wodi and Dr. Neil Murthy, in light of many additions and edits to the schedules this year. I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of my ACIP colleagues, Veronica McNally and Dr. Matthew Daley, and thank the many liaison representatives, ex officio members, consultants, and CDC subject matters listed here and on the next slide who have contributed to the work group activities. Next slide. As a reminder, presentations and updates to both schedules may include the use of vaccine trade names. This is for identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement by CDC. The proposed edits that will be discussed are subject to change based on ACIPs discussion and vote. Next slide. For today's presentation, Dr. Wodi will discuss the proposed edits for the 2024 Child and Adolescent schedule, as well as the proposed edits for the 2024 Adult Immunization Schedule. These edits are intended to incorporate ACIP recommendations that have occurred since October of 2022, improve readability and utility of the schedule into a language that is easy to interpret for practitioners. The session will conclude with discussion of the proposed edits followed by a vote on the adult schedule and the child and adolescent schedule.

      "{'end_time': '1:11:44 ', 'character_lenght': 16469, 'text': \" Thank you Dr. Cineas, let me just share my slide. I'm just pulling u my slide, give me a minute. Good morning everyone. My name is Dr. Wodi and together with Dr. Murthy we co-lead the combined immunization schedule work group. I will begin by presenting the 2024 updates to the child and adolescent schedule. I will walk through the proposed changes for the cover page and the tables, then the vaccination notes and then the appendix and introduce the newly added addendum. The 2024 updates include new and updated recommendations for vaccines and write texts. Additionally, we've made clarifying edits to the other vaccines listed on the slide, I will present only the substantive updates to the schedule, minor grammatical formatting edits to improve clarity will not be presented. Now, beginning with the cover page of the child and adolescent schedule. In the box for how to use the schedule we've added this six step for providers to review the addendum for ACIP recommendations that will occur after the schedule is published. The title for the table listing the names and abbreviation has been changed to vaccines and other immunizing agents because we've added nirsevimab to the table. Nirsevimab has been added in a separate section at the top to indicate that is a monoclonal antibody and not a vaccine. In the table listing the vaccine names and abbreviations we have a new rule for RSV vaccine and we've listed only the brand Abrysvo because this is the only brand approved for using pregnancy. In the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine role, we've deleted PCV 13 and added PCV 20 to be consistent with the current guidelines. And then we've added new rules for mpox vaccine JYNNEOS and the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine. Lastly, on the cover page, we've deleted some vaccines that are no longer distributed or recommended for use in the United States. So we've deleted the bivalent mRNA vaccine. The diphtheria tetanus vaccine is no longer available. So that row has been deleted and then from the meningococcal A, C, W, Y row was deleted Menactra. Moving on to table one which outlines the immunization schedule by age. In table one, the column header has also been changed to vaccine and other immunizing agents to account for adding nirsevimab to the table. We have a new row for nirsevimab and we've shaded the ages back through eight months in yellow indicating the age for routine immunization. We also have an overlay in texting. One does depending on maternal RSV vaccination status. And then for ages eight through 19 months, we've shaded that in purple to indicate that it's for those eight through 19 months who at increased risk of severe RSV disease, and we've added see notes to direct healthcare providers to the notes section for more information for these two age groups. We've added RSV vaccine to table one and we've shaded 11 years to 18 years in purple. And we have an overlaying text in our administration during pregnancy and just you know. In the pneumococcal conjugate row, again, we've taken out PCV 13, and added PCV 20. And the pneumococcal polysaccharide row has been deleted because that vaccine is no longer recommended for all children who are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease. In the meningococcal row, we've removed Menactra. And in the COVID-19 row we've removed the mRNA bivalent vaccine, and we've changed the overlaying text to indicate to use the 2023/24 formula. And lastly, to table one, we've added a new row for mpox vaccine and we've shaded it in purple indicated it should be used based on risk factors. Moving on to table two, which outlines the catch up schedule for children and adolescents who are beginning their immunization later on more than one month behind. We have two minor edits for table two. In the DTaP row for those four to five with clarify the interval to put a note stating that the fifth dose is not necessary if the fourth dose was administered at age four years or older, and at least six months after dose three. And the other change is to remove Menactra from the meningococcal A, C, W, Y row. Now table three lists the immunization schedule by medical indication. This year, we've extensively revised table three to more closely aligned with the instructions, which is that is to be used to assess additional vaccines that will be needed based on medical condition or indications. And the reason we did this was because we've received feedback from lots of healthcare providers that the legend definitions were unclear and they were used inconsistently across the row. When we went the work group changed the color definitions and we harmonized this with the child schedule and applied it to all the row. So for this 2024 table three looks a lot different. These are the new legend color definitions, we've clarified that yellow represents recommended for all age eligible children who lack documentation of a complete vaccination series. Previously just said vaccinated according to the routine schedule, so we've explained what that means. And then for purple, we've indicated that it's not recommended for all children, but some children can receive the vaccine based on their increased risk for all severe outcomes from disease. The definition for brown did not change it indicates additional doses are needed, but we changed the color from checked yellow to brown so that the overlaying text is more visible. And then lastly, for gray we changed no recommendation not applicable to no guidance or not applicable. We've also changed the table header. We've revised it for clarity. So we say always use this table -- always use the table in conjunction with table one and the notes section. And we indicate that there's some medical conditions not listed on this table and to see notes. Note section. Similar to table one with changing header to vaccine and other immunizing agents. We've met the DTaP and Tdap rows into one row and in the pregnancy column we've indicated that one dose of Tdap is recommended for each pregnancy. We've also merged the pneumococcal rows into a single row. And indicated with a brown color that additional doses are needed for those medical conditions. For nirsevimab we've added it as a new row. And then for those children and adolescents who are immunocompromised or have chronic lung disease, we've used the brown color to indicate that additional doses are needed. And an overlaying text to say this is in the second RSV season and an instruction to see the notes. For RSV vaccine, the pregnancy column is in yellow indicating is recommended for all pregnant women. And then we have the overlaying text, seasonal administration. For all the other medical conditions we have this in purple, because any pregnant person who has any of these medical conditions can also receive the vaccine. We have a new row for mpox vaccine and all the medical conditions as shaded in purple, indicating that anyone who has this medical condition and has the sexual risk factors should be vaccinated. Now I'll go over the edits to the notes. In the additional information and section in the bullet for the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, we've added RSV vaccine as one of the vaccines that is not covered by VICP. The COVID-19 vaccination notes have been extensively revised to be in line with the current recommendation. The routine vaccination section lists the recommendations for persons who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised, and we've outlined the recommendations by age group and the number of previous COVID-19 doses received. The special situation section outlines the recommendations for persons who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. And we've also outlined the recommendations by age group and number of previous doses received. At the end of the COVID-19 notes, we've included some information that we think will be helpful for healthcare providers, including that is no preferential recommendation when more than one recommended age appropriate vaccine is available. We included links to the age transition information, the interim guidance EUA. We've also added the definition for previously vaccinated. And then lastly, we have a note for additional doses in persons who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. Moving on to HPV, we've made some minor edits here, we deleted the bullet on interrupted HPV schedule because this information is on the cover page and it applies to all vaccines. For situations where no additional doses are recommended, we've clarified that persons who have completed their HPV series with any HPV vaccine do not need additional doses. And we did that by adding of any valency to the sentence. For influenza vaccination, we've taken out all the bullets for persons who have a history of egg allergy. And at the end of the section we've included a note saying that persons with egg allergy can receive any influenza vaccine egg-based or non-egg based appropriate for age and health status. And we've included a link to the current recommendation for the 2023/24 season. In the MMR vaccination notes, we have moved the bullet for the minimum interval between MMR doses to the end of the section and we've used asterix to indicate that it applies to routine catch up in special situations. Previously, it was in the catch up vaccinations section and some healthcare providers found that confusing. For MenACWY we've deleted Menactra from all the sections and we've added the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine. At the end of that section we have some information for the newly recommended pentavalent vaccine. And children aged 10 years or older may receive a single dose of the pentavalent vaccine as an alternative to separate administration of MenACWY and MenB, when both vaccines will be given on the same day on a single injection where the pentavalent vaccine is preferred. In the MenB note we've added a link to the shared clinical decision making -- to a shared link for decision making resource. And at the end of the note we also have information for the use of the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine. Here we have a lot more information than in the MenACWY note. So children aged 10 years or older may receive a dose of the pentavalent vaccine as an alternative to separate administration of MenACWY and MenB when both vaccines will be given on the same clinic day and a single injection where the pentavalent vaccine is preferred. For age eligible children who are not at increased risk if the pentavalent vaccine is used for MenB dose one then remember should be administered for those two. That's because MenB vaccines are not interchangeable. And then for children -- for age eligible children who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease those who need additional MenACWY and MenB doses including for booster doses can use the pentavalent vaccine, if both vaccines will be given on the same day, and at least six months has elapsed since the most recent pentavalent dose. And then lastly, we'll clarify that for those ideally reachable children recommended to receive booster doses of MenACWY and MenB less than six months after the dose of a pentavalent vaccine they should get their doses separately. We have a new section for mpox vaccine and we've listed the recommendations for persons aged 18 years and at risk for mpox will be sexual risk factors listed. We have a bullet for pregnancy stating there's currently no ACIP recommendation for JYNNEOS using pregnancy due to lack of safety data in pregnant persons, while pregnant persons with any risk factor described above may receive JYNNEOS. For pneumococcal vaccination, again, we've taken out PCV 13 and added PCV 20. We've added a note stating that either PCV 15 or PCV 20 can be used where the PCV vaccine is indicated. PCV 20 is not indicated for children who have received four doses of PCV 13 or PCV 15 or another age appropriate complete PCV series. Where we have listed the non-immunocompromising conditions that increase the risk for invasive pneumococcal disease we've added chronic kidney disease excluding maintenance dialysis and nephrotic syndrome, because these are listed in immunocompromising section. We've added back chronic liver disease and for chronic lung disease we've specified that this includes moderate persistent or severe persistent asthma. And the recommendations are outlined by each group. And for each age group we've outlined the recommendations based on their previous pneumococcal vaccination history. For polio virus in the catch up vaccination, based on the new recommendation, we've added language for those who are age 18 years, known or suspected to be unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. We've also clarified that unless there are specific reasons to believe they were not vaccinated, most persons aged 18 years old or older were born and raised in the United States can be assumed that they were vaccinated against polio as children. And then in the special situations section, we've outlined the recommendation for those who have completed their primary series were at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus. And at the bottom we have a note that defines what a complete primary series means. For RSV immunization with nirsevimab, we have a new note section and in the routine immunization section we have two bullets. One outlines the recommendations for infants from October through March in most of the continental United States and the other for infants born April through September. And in each of these bullets, we've outlined the recommendation based on maternal RSV vaccination history. In the special situation section we've outlined the recommendations for children ages eight months through 19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease. In that section we also have a bullet for age eligible children who are undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass who need additional dose of nirsevimab and we have the link to where more information is available. And then at the end of the section, we've added some information on the timing of nirsevimab administration based on local RSV seasonality and information on the use of nirsevimab in children who are eligible to receive palivizumab. And we also added a resources which is a link to the nirsevimab frequently asked question web page. For RSV vaccine, we've outlined the routine recommendation for pregnant women at age 32 through 36 week's gestation, from September through January most of the United States. We've also indicated that either maternal RSV vaccination or infant immunization with nirsevimab is recommended to prevent RSV disease in the infant. And then, just like in the nirsevimab section, we have information on the timing of RSV vaccine based on local RSV seasonality. In the notes for Tdap, we've made some edits, mainly to clarify that 11 to 12 year Tdap dose is the adolescent booster. Now we'll go over the appendix which leaves the contraindications and precautions for each vaccine listed in the schedule. At the header, we've added the link to where you can find the contraindications and precautions for COVID-19 vaccine, the most recent influenza recommendations for 23/24 and also for JYNNEOS vaccination. We've also changed the header to vaccines and other immunizing agents. This year, the contraindications and precautions for COVID-19 vaccines have been incorporated into the table. We have a one row for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and a separate row the protein subunit vaccine. We've also added in a server map and RSV vaccine to the table and in the footnotes we've included the link to the package insert for nirsevimab. We've also added the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine to the table listing the contraindications and precautions. And mpox vaccine JYNNEOS. Lastly, we've deleted some information from this table in the DTaP row we've removed the diphtheria tetanus vaccine because that's no longer distributed in the United States. And in the Haemophilus influenzae row, we've removed the bullet for severe allergy to not dry natural latex because that's no longer included in the package insert. And in the meningococcal row, we've removed the information for Menactra. Lastly, I will go over the addendum it's currently blank. And what we intend to do is after this schedule is published, any ACIP vote or recommendation will be listed in the addendum.

And I'll make two other quick points. One is that we often are operating in a circumstance where there's an electronic health record. Some of these are amenable to electronic health record prompts. And some of these aren't, naturally, something like special situations. And I say this with all the love that Dr. Kotton expressed about the schedule, about the visual representation of the schedule here. But the second point is that I'm often looking up a specific vaccine, because there's some detail that I need there. But here, you have to go from one table to the notes, to then get the additional information you're seeking versus some other strategy where you're able to find a vaccine with those recommendations very quickly, could be app based and should be factored in whether you're operating in an EHR environment or not.

And then it says, I can hardly read it. It says vaccinate after pregnancy, I think is the word, if indicated. So I have recently seen two children in the first month of life, who I recognize this very mild varicella who I then asked the question of the mother, tell me about where you've been, and these were immigrant families. The mother delivered. The mother is from South America, one central America, one South America didn't have varicella as a child, undoubtedly baby has no antibody, mother gets a vaccine in the postpartum period day that she delivers and goes home, and she got a few lesions, the baby got skin disseminated varicella, both of them not severely ill. But led to spinal tap treatment with Acyclovir thinking it was herpes. And happily, I was there. None of the other people in the whole place had seen varicella to know that that's what that looked like. So I just don't think the postpartum time -- I'm sure it's a public health measure, gets people vaccinated but it's not a good time for this vaccine which is a little bit skin transmissible if the mother gets lesions. And maybe mothers from South America who never had varicella are more likely to get lesions than all the people we give it to in the United States who had varicella. However, as I thought about it, we're getting to the point where we're having babies born with only maternal vaccine protection. And I don't know, you know, if that will be adequate for this kind of transmission. So I just wondered, I bet you struggled with not saying in the postpartum period, but you say, after pregnancy, and I suspect that some people are translating this to postpartum. And so I think some group ought to look at that and see if that's still the right thing to do, I would be fine. You know, the first month and like baby is not immunologically normal. And although we know varicella is very bad in the first two weeks, it's probably not perfect if you get it in this third week, or the fourth week. And then the other thing that I think is a public health measure too that isn't on these things is what you do for people, when they come to the border. You give them a lot of vaccines, there was just a child presented at our ID week, who was 15/16 months old, who got MMRNV and 10 days later had the diagnosis of a severe malignancy. Now, did somebody not -- did somebody miss that this child didn't look healthy 10 days before? But ended up with enormously complicated course and terrible varicella, pneumonia, and then measles, both vaccine virus pneumonia. So I don't know what to do about that. It's still a good idea to vaccinate people, but maybe it is just education. For people that ask the questions nobody thought about this -- \", 'time_delta': 218, 'start_time': '1:27:36 '}\n",

And I will just express my opinion that as we move towards a respiratory viral prevention platform, I do think perhaps we should think about how we can harmonize across flu COVID and RSV, some of the conditions, because I don't necessarily -- there's like unusual circumstances like CSF leaks, for example, with pneumococcal vaccine. But other than that, I certainly am suggesting that this schedule actually highlights some of the minor differences, but they can be significant to patients. And I do think we need to start to harmonize some of the conditions as evidence allows and as is reasonable from an implementation standpoint, for our providers, given the complexity of the schedule.

      "{'end_time': '1:50:44 ', 'character_lenght': 10127, 'text': \" All right, so most of the updates to the adult schedule are similar to the child and adolescent schedule. So I'll go over the changes to the cover page tables, vaccination notes, appendix, and the addendum. So on the 2024 updates includes new and updated recommendations for the vaccine in red -- for the vaccines list in red. And then for the others, we've made clarifying edits just like we did for the child. So, on the cover page for how to use the schedule, we have a fifth step instructing providers to review the addendum where we're going to list the recommendations that we'll call after the schedule is published. In the table listing the names and abbreviations we've added the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine, mpox and RSV vaccine. And here for RSV vaccine, we have the two brands listed as opposed to the child schedule. And then we've deleted the bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and Menactra from this table. I'll table one list the recommended vaccines by age. For COVID-19, we've changed the overlaying text to specify that the 2023/24 formula should be used. For RSV we have age 19 to 49 years in purple indicated that is recommended for some adults not all adults, and we have the overlaying text seasonal administration during pregnancy, see notes. And then for 60 years and older we have the blue bar indicating that this is a shared clinical decision making recommendation. For the pneumococcal row, we have removed the overlaying text that said either use PCV 15 plus PPSV 23 or PCV 20 because the recommendations have been outdated and it's a lot more nuances than what we had. And we've added mpox and all the ages are shaded in purple indicating that if you have a risk factor, you should be vaccinated. Now table two list the recommendations by medical indications and is similar to table three in the child schedule. And we did the same thing we wanted to align more closely to the instructions for how to use the schedule, so identify additional doses recommended based on the medical condition. And we also revise the color legends for this table and harmonized it with the child's schedule. But here for the yellow, we now have that is recommended for all adults who lack documentation of vaccination or lack of evidence of past infection. Those are slight revisions from the 2023 wording, we just took the age and put it in a purple. So the purple now represents that it's not recommended for all adults, but it's recommended for some adults based on either their age or their risk for infection of severe outcome. Brown is new to the table. And we wanted to indicate that for some of these medical conditions, additional doses of vaccines will be needed. And this was to harmonize with the child's schedule and the gray we now have no guidance or not applicable. And we've added the same header to table two like we did for the table three in the child's schedule, just letting providers know that you use this table with table one and the notes. And that there's some medical conditions that are not listed on the slide to see the notes section and that individuals could have made multiple medical conditions. And in the Hepatitis B row for diabetes, we've indicated that for those aged 60 years and older the recommendation is shared clinical decision making. And for RSV we have -- for pregnancy we have a yellow indicator that is recommended for all pregnant women and the overlaying text is null administration. And for the other medical conditions we had -- we use the blue because of the shared clinical decision making in older adults. But now looking at this and based on the previous conversations maybe it should be gray to change it to gray. And then for mpox we have all the medical conditions in purple. Because anyone with this medical conditions can have the sexual risk factors recommended for vaccination. For pregnancy we've added see notes, and for men who have sex with men see notes and healthcare personnel see notes because [inaudible] to the recommendation. Now moving to the notes section. This year we've added the Additional Information section to the adults schedule to harmonize with the child's schedule. In the bullet for the National Injury Compensation program. We've added RSV and would add mpox like previously noted for this CICP program. COVID-19 vaccination has been extensively revised to align with the new recommendation for routine vaccination. This is for persons who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised. And the special situation section lists the recommendations for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised based on their previous COVID-19 vaccination history. And just like we did in the child's schedule, we have some information that we think will be helpful for healthcare providers that know professional recommendations, links to more information of the schedule and the EUA. The definition for what previously vaccinated means and then some information for additional doses and those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. Now for Hepatitis A for routine vaccination, we wanted to clarify that people who are not fully vaccinated they don't have a risk factor but are requesting the vaccine can get the vaccine, so we revised that bullet to say any person who is not fully vaccinated and requests vaccination, identification of risk factors is not required they can be vaccinated. And then for those who are at risk, we just changed the wording just to match what we have in the routine vaccination section. For Hepatitis B we added a new bullet that adults 60 years of age and older who request Hepatitis B vaccine should receive the vaccine. And for the -- for those who are diabetes -- those living with diabetes and 60s and older, we've added a notation to say that this is shared clinical decision making recommendation. We made similar -- for HPV vaccination we made similar changes to the child's schedule which was to revamp the bullet on interrupted schedule. And then to clarify that if you've completed your HPV vaccination series with any of the HPV vaccines, you do not need additional doses. For influenza vaccination, we've taken out all the bullet for persons with a history of egg allergy. And we've added a note that they can now receive any influenza vaccine appropriate for their age and health status. And we have the link to the 2023/24 recommendation. We also had a bullet here for persons who had a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome within six weeks of influenza vaccine. We took that out because we already have that in the appendix. For meningococcal vaccination, we've added information for shared clinical decision making resource. And we've also added the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine at the end and we will also remove the preferred language from this section too. For mpox vaccine, we've listed -- we have a special situation section for those that risk and we've listed what the risk factors are. We also have the same bullet for pregnancy like we had in the child. In addition to that we have a bullet for healthcare personnel stating that except in rare circumstances, such as when no available personnel protective equipment, healthcare personnel do not have -- who do not have any of those sexual risk factors describable should not receive JYNNEOS. And we added this because there's been a few questions about if healthcare personnel providing clinical care for patients with input should be vaccinated. The meningococcal section was extensively revised just to clarify -- primarily to clarify the minimum intervals based on which product is used. And then for polio vaccination. Based on the new recommendation, we now have a routine vaccination wording which says adults known or suspected to be unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated should complete the series. And in the special situation section we have adults who are at increased risk of exposure to polio who have completed the series may receive one lifetime booster, and we have included the definition of what a complete primary series is. For RSV vaccination, the routine section addresses the recommendations for pregnant persons. We have that pregnant persons should be vaccinated at 32 through 36 weeks gestation, from September through January most of the United States. And we've also included the language based on time and based on local RSV seasonality. We also thought it was important to refer to nirsevimab in this section. So we have the language that either maternal RSV or infant immunization with nirsevimab is recommended. And we refer -- we refer to the child's schedule for recommendations for nirsevimab in infants. The special situation section here addresses the shared link or decision making for those 60 years or older. We've listed the two vaccines brand that can be used here. And we've also provided some information for persons that are considered at increased risk for severe RSV disease. And then for the Tdap notes, we've clarified that a Tdap dose administered at 10 years may be counted as the adolescent dose recommended at age 11 through 12 years. Now moving on to the appendix which lays the contraindications and precautions. Similar to the child's schedule we've revised the header to include the links to the contraindications for JYNNEOS and COVID-19 vaccine and we've updated the link to the -- for influenza vaccine to the current recommendation. We have incorporated COVID-19 vaccines into the table. And we have a different row for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and then for the protein subunit vaccine. We've added RSV vaccine, contraindications and precautions to the table. And in the -- we've also added the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine to the table. And mpox. And similar to the child's schedule we've deleted the bullet for severe allergic to latex from the hip vaccine rule. And we've also deleted Menactra from the meningococcal vaccine row. And lastly to the addendum, which is currently blank, here's where we're going to list all the recommendations that will occur after the schedule is published.
